To figure that out we would have to test our approximations on every single graph for approx1(). And for the other two the non-deterministic nature of the algorithms makes this even more problematic. However, we may be able to test the worst case for approx1() on very small graphs. How would you generate all graphs of size 5 for example?\n",
