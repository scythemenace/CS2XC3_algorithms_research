When you post a message on Teams, make sure to include your Lab Section in the message and the number of members you are seeking. You can also ask the TA of your lab section to help you find your group mates. Do not wait until the last minute to do this.\n",

Discuss within the team, a) the expectations from each member on being a **team player**, as well as an **individual contributor**, b) culture and norms on handling unexpected issues such as health and personal crisis, c) protocols for providing timely and constructive feedback on each other's performance to ensure team success.\n",
