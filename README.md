## CS2XC3 | Experimentation on behaviour of algorithms and data structures
### Overview
This repository contains implementations, analyses, and modifications of core algorithms and data structures covered in the CS2XC3 course. The project delves into the inner workings of fundamental concepts and explores how algorithmic behavior changes under constraints or when adapted for specific use cases.
### Key Explorations
* Graph Algorithms: Implementations of Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, A^*^, etc. with an emphasis on understanding their use cases and handling different input scenarios (e.g., negative weights).
* Data Structures: Examinations of stacks, queues, trees, etc., and how design choices affect their performance characteristics.
* Sorting and searching algorithm: Comparing their speeds with respect to each other by plotting the results.
* Algorithm Adaptations: Investigations into modifications of standard algorithms to handle specific constraints or to optimize for certain inputs.
### Project Highlights
* Detailed code implementations in Python (or the language you used).
* Discussions on the time and space complexity of algorithms.
* Exploration of edge cases by changing the implementations for certain data structures for example negative cycles in graph algorithms and how they impact shortest path calculations.
* Examples and test cases demonstrating algorithm applications and edge cases.
### Usage
##### To run the code for each experiments:-
* Clone the repository
* Code examples are located in appropriate folder names.
* Analysis and discussions are provided either in the .ipynb or analaysis pdf separately in the same folder.
* Each **Lab** folder **may** have a code_experiment, converted_pdf_of_results and an instructions file.
  * code_experiment refers to the .ipynb file where the experiments were created and stored.
  * converted_pdf_of_results is the pdf counterpart of .ipynb files. For people who are not able to view .ipynb files on browser can open them.
  * instructions file, as the name says, showcases what instructions we were supposed to follow when designing the experiments.
* For the Final folder, we were supposed to design detailed experiments about Shortest Path algorithms.
  * The "Instructions for experiments" file showcases the instructions given to us based on which we had to design the experiments.
  * The "Explanation Report" file has detailed documentation of experiment goals, outcomes, and reflections.
  * If a particular experiment requires explanation of a specific rubric we were required to follow, there will be a .txt file inside that specific experiment folder.
### Contributions
This repository is open to contributions and improvements. Since we were researching and learning about certain concepts for the course it's not perfect or error proof. If you have suggestions or find areas where the explanations and implementations can be enhanced, please feel free to open an issue, submit a pull request or reach out to pankur216@gmail.com, aaravpant00@gmail.com or joshimegh2004@gmail.com
